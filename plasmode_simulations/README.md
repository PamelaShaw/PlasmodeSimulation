# plasmode_simulations

This directory contains code used for the plasmode simulations. Due to data restrictions, we cannot share the underlying data. However, the code can be used to understand the approach we took and may be helpful for replicating the results on a different dataset. For information about how to obtain the data used for this simulation, contact Pamela Shaw at pamela.a.shaw@kp.org.

The code in this directory is:
* `00_plasmode_utils.R`: generally useful functions, many identical to those used in the synthetic simulations
* `01_plasmode_main.R`: the main code to run the simulation
* `02_plasmode_results.R`: the code to create tables and figures with simulation results
